I've typically noticed that for binary search questions, a couple characteristics spring up in common:

- The problem asks for the minimum *** or the maximum *** and it just seems like a brute-force question.
- Huge lim for variables, so it's impossible to brute-force it.
- Heavy use of while loops, greedy algorithm 
- Almost like it's cheating to get the answer (hah!)
